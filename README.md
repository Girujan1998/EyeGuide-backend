# Setting Up Backend

This README should assist in setting up the backend instance on your local environment, from getting Django, Postgres and other applications working.

## Before working with backend architecture

This is done to prevent the OS intefering with the backend setup and packages, while also isolating our environment so we all work with the same type of environment.
